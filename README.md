Here I have added some React JS programs what I have learned.

Displaying Message Folder

I have done my first program in React JS to display the message Hello React..!

In calculator project i have created a simple calculator to do some basic arithmetic operations like addition,subtraction,multiplication and division.
Using React you can see the dynamic results in the screen.

Next in DateAndTime project i have programmed to display current date and time in the web page. React has one benefit that date and time can be visualized dynamically which was not in amgular or js.

In Toggle just used to on/off the buttons.
